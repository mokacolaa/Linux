## üß† Lessons & Reflections

When I began, the Linux terminal felt intimidating and unfamiliar. But over time, by practicing regularly and setting up my own WSL 2 environment, I started to understand its power and flexibility.

I installed Ubuntu locally via WSL 2, but my fully customized ZSH terminal was configured on an AWS EC2 instance. This cloud-based setup gave me practical experience working with remote servers and key DevOps tools like SSH for secure access.

Editing dotfiles like `.zshrc` taught me how much control I could have over my tools. I made plenty of mistakes along the way‚Äîwrong permissions, broken installs, but each one taught me something new.

Learning to use `sudo` safely helped me avoid accidentally breaking things. Tools like `grep`, `head`, `tail`, `vim`, and `ssh` became essential for inspecting files, editing configs, and connecting to remote machines.

To build confidence and test my understanding, I worked through the OverTheWire Bandit wargame. It challenged me to use the `man` pages extensively and reinforced each command through real application. I used videos and documentation to deepen my understanding before using commands. While some levels required walkthroughs, breaking them down helped me learn even more, especially in how to approach problems systematically.

Creating aliases and learning shortcuts also helped speed up my workflow. Linux is no longer something I avoid; it‚Äôs now part of how I learn, build, and solve problems.
